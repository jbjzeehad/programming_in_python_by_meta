>>  1. Syntax errors - misspelling or typo
    2. Exceptions - code execution

Syntax errors are caused by human errors such as typos or misspelling. Known errors that need to be handled are exceptions.
It is possible to handle more than one exception without knowing what they are ahead oftime by chaining except statements together.

try except is used in Python for exception handling. Exception is the base class for all user-defined exceptions in Python.

>> IndexError

try:
    item = items[6]
    print(item)
except: 
    print("The index does not exist in the list.")

>> ZeroDivisionError

def divide_by(a, b):
    try:
        return a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return 0
    except Exception as e:
        print(e, 'Something went wrong!')

ans = divide_by(10,0)
print(ans)

>> FileNotFoundError: The FileNotFoundError will be displayed where a file cannot be located.

try:
    with open('file_does_not_exist.txt', 'r') as file:
        print(file.read())
except:
    print("Unable to locate file")
